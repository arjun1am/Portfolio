        <span class="subheading">Problem</span>
        There are many people who face self judgemental or self
        critical thoughts on a daily basis. These thoughts often become normalized
        in our lives and contribute to feelings of depression and isolation.
        </span>
        <span>
        <span class="subheading">Design Outcome</span>
        Cometta(Co meaning together, Metta meaning loving kindness) is
        an app that will help you be mindful and respond kindly to your self critical thinking
        through a series of exercises. You can share
        this kindness by sending and receiving kind messages all over the world.
        </span>
       </p>

       <p class="paragraph">
         <span class="subheading">Overview </span>
        Cometta efficiently and effectively guides the user through the challenging
        and impactful journey of cultivating self-compassion. Microinteraction,
        gesture, and UI animation provide meaning and enhance usability.
       </p>

           <span class="subheading subheadingdark">Send Kind Messages </span>
           You are not alone. Just as you feel and experience self criticism,
           judgement, and suffering, other people across the world feel and experience
           the same as well. Cometta brings recognition of this fact to the forefront of
           the experience through the act of sending kind messages.
          <br><br>
           Releasing a kind message out to the world for others to receive helps you
           cultivate a perspective of common humanity, which is a key element of self compassion.

         <span class="subheading subheadingdark">Receive Kind Messages </span>
         Just as you send kindness out with a gesture swiping upwards, swipe
         downwards towards yourself to receive a kind message.
         <br><br>
         View, filter, save, and share kind messages sent from around the
         world to experience a sense of common humanity. A single kind message
         can help shift your perspective and look at your feelings of suffering
         from a kind and connected lens.

      <p class="paragraph">
        <span class="subheading">Mindfulness and Kindness </span>
        Through mindfulness exercises, the user learns how to be more clear about
        their own thoughts, experiences, and behaviors. Once this level of mindfulness
        is achieved, the user then has ability to reframe the existing patterns of
        their mind through kindness exercises.
        <br><br>
        Microinteractions have been designed to make this introspective and
        challenging journey more understandable, usable, and efficient for
        multiple contexts and users.

      <p class="paragraph">
       <span class="subheading">Process</span>
       Cometta was my graduation project at Emily Carr University of Art and
       Design. As the sole designer for this project I was responsible for a
       wide range of the design process from <span style="color:#233042; font-weight:500">product concept ideation </span> to, <span style="color:#233042; font-weight:500">user research</span>
       and <span style="color:#233042; font-weight:500">UI/visual design.</span>
       <br><br>
       The project began as an exploration into the question:
       <br>
       How might we design something that focuses on a transformative aspect
       of mindfulness?
      </p>

         </video>
      </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="subheading">Concept Ideation </span>
      Rapid sketching and prototyping allowed me to quickly explore many ideas. Video
      prototyping was a useful tool I used to get feedback on whether
      my ideas made sense and resonated with people. Through the video, the user could immediately
      see what is clear and not clear to them without a verbal explanation.
      During this ideation process, I arrived at many concepts around the topic of self- compassion.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
     <span class="subheading">Research </span>
     From secondary research I learned that people who have self- critical thoughts have been shown
     to have an increased risk of depression, and other mental illnesses. Forms
     of self- criticism include dwelling on mistakes, a sense of inadequacy, and
     feelings of self- hate and disgust.
     <br><br>
     Some examples of self- critical thoughts are:
    </p>

      <blockquote>
        <span>
        "I'm too unlikable to lead the engineering team"<br><br>
        "I'm not a good enough father for my kids"<br><br>
        "Bob is so much more social than me"<br>
        </span>
      </blockquote>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Volunteering and charity work was an immediate association for the term compassion.
      So, as a form of <span style="color:#233042; font-weight:500">field study</span> research,
      I went volunteering to help make and distribute sandwiches for the homeless in Vancouver.
      <br><br>
      Conversations with volunteers were very insightful. One volunteer mentioned how
      she was unhappy with her career and the sort of rat race associated with it.
      Seeing other people do things selflessly and without getting paid was what
      inspired her to volunteer more herself and give her time to people in need. Inspiration
      is a word that I feel captured the experience of volunteering well.
    </p>

      <blockquote>
        <span>
        <br>
        “I become so inspired … they are not getting paid to do it
        ...give my time to people in need”
        <br>
        </span>
      </blockquote>

    <div class="comettaimages">
      <img src="../assets/volunteer1.jpg" alt="field study paper lunch bag decorations" class="imgs">
      <p style="color:grey; font-size:12px;"> volunteering: paper bag decorations</p>
    </div>

    <p class="paragraph">
      At another volunteering event, where volunteers decorated paper lunch bags with
      encouraging words for people in need, I used the phrases spoken during loving
      kindness(metta) meditation which I was introduced to at a guided mindfulness meditation class.
      <br><br>
      My conversations with volunteers and my experiences volunteering,
      led me to think about a target user of working adults. Based on my observational insights
      and preliminary personas, empathy maps, and user journeys,
      a more refined problem statement was discovered:
      <br><br>
      Work life can be very unfulfilling and the competitive and fast paced nature of
      modern jobs can lead to self- critical and judgmental thoughts. Design a simple and
      cohesive experience that can be used by working adults to notice, examine, and
      reframe self- critical thoughts (cultivate self- compassion).
      <br><br>
      Throughout the process of sketching and refining ideas, I looked at existing
      products in the market space for reference and <span style="color:#233042; font-weight:500">competitive analysis</span>.
      What I found was that the topic of self- compassion is not a focus of these apps.
      The goal of my design was to bring the conversation of self- compassion to the
      forefront of the mindfulness space.

    <p class="paragraph">
     <span class="subheading">Prototyping</span>
     Based on my research I had created a user flow. The goal of my first (formal)
     prototype was to physically map out this flow and test it out. Simple
     pdf instructions guided the user through a 1 minute audio mindfulness
     meditation, and a self kindness exercise. For the last step, users wrote out
     a kind message for the other participants on a poster titled the kind message network.

           <span> Prototype v2 test using Figma Mirror: <br><br>
             I conducted multiple low fidelity prototype tests like this with multilple
             people to see how the user navigates through the app and observe any
             usability, layout, or content issues in the prototype.
           </span>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The design decisions I made were informed by prototype testing feedback and insights like these.
          In this way, I went through many digital iterations of design. Layout, flow, navigation, animation
          and more were continuously improved upon in each prototype iteration. Some of the key design
          decisions I made came from prototype testing insights.
          <br><br>

      <strong style="color:#233042;">Key Prototype Testing  Insights:</strong><br><br>
     ⭐ Touch screen gestures and animation really resonate with the users as they go through
     the journey. These can communicate meaning and grab the user's attention.<br><br>
     ⭐ Giving the user freedom to control is necessary as the context in which the user
     is using the app can have time, and sensory limitations.<br><br>
     ⭐ The way in which the user learns about the exercises and terms is very important
     and should be clear and simple. Iterations where
     narrative or metaphorical elements were used, were unsuccessful and confusing for
     the users.<br><br>
     ⭐ Progressively guiding through the experience with microinteractions can help
     first time users of the app learn the layout and navigation without getting lost or overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      <span class="subheading">User Research Revisit</span>
     In addition to prototype testing, user research informed the design in a big way.
     Referring back and refining my user research was an ongoing process. What was lacking in my
     secondary, field study and competitive research, was more specific, non- assumption, and user centred
     research that could inform the value proposition and design of the product.
     <br><br>
     To solve this, I had done user interviews where I asked 3 adults about their average
     working day and specific pain-points in their work life.
     <br><br>
    </p>

     <p style="background-color:rgba(35, 48, 66,.05); padding-top:5%;padding-bottom:5%; border-radius:10px; " class="paragraph">
    <strong style="color:#233042;">Key User Interview Insights:</strong><br><br>
     ⭐ People are really motivated to succeed and success in their job brings them happiness. This can be
     a double edged sword. If they find it hard to successfuly do their job, their happiness suffers. Self- compassion
     can help them develop a mental resilience to their work obstacles.
     <br><br>
     ⭐ Many of them have pretty busy and full schedules. This means that they dont have much time
     to relax or work on their hobbies.
     <br><br>
     ⭐ Common pains include dealing with difficult people, having tight deadlines, and
     unexpected interruptions in their schedules.
     <br><br>
     ⭐ Something they already do during their breaks is communicate with loved ones.
     A feature that taps into this existing flow can be a gain creator for the user.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
     With this step complete, I was able to refine and digitize my existing persona to reflect my
     new insights, and create a more focused value propostion, and user scenario.

      <span class="subheading">Visual Identity Development</span>
      Driving the visual design is this idea of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHMIfOecrlo" target="_blank">overview effect</a>.
      Just as astronauts gain a new perspective and feeling of oneness, or common
      humanity with the world, the visual design of cometta seeks to emulate that
      feeling through its visual and motion design elements.
      <br><br>
      I began my exploration into a visual identity with a collage. I continued work
      on visual identity and design in Apple's Keynote and Adobe Illustrator in order to easily animate
      and play around with colors, shapes, and layouts of UI elements. This was a
      divergent and exploratory process.
      <br><br>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Iterations of the visual identity developed alongside and was informed by the
        iterations of user testing and feedback. Through the various visuals below,
        you can get an idea of how the app evolved beyond the look and feel of the initial collage.

            Evolving the look and feel: <br><br>
           After receiving negative feedback on the visual style of the previous prototype,
           I experimented in Keynote with color, animation, and imagery in order to rework and
           create a visual identity that better communicates the app concepts. Keynote transitions
           allowed me to iterate on animation and interaction as well.
         </span>
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph">
      The final look and feel of the app distills the many explorations into a
      cohesive and minimalist visual identity and UI. The final app visuals seen at
      the beginning of the case study were animated in Adobe After Effects for more
      clarity and control over the animations.

      <span class="subheading">Final Thoughts + Next Steps</span>
      The final design outcome was determined heavily through user research and the iterative
      process of prototyping, testing, and refinement. Ultimately the core experience of
      cultivating self- compassion is designed through the micro- interactions, gestures, and animation.
      A continuous challenge in the process was maintaining a balance between depth and simplicity of the
      experience in order to bring in more engagement and interest from users. Placing focus
      on kind message sharing, differentiates Cometta from existing mindfulness
      apps that might touch upon self- compassion as a part rather than the whole of their offering.
      <br><br>
      A meaningful next step would be to conduct a thorough test of how effective
      the app is at giving users the ability to shift their self- critical thoughts
      towards more self- compassionate ones. This would require a serious time
      commitment from testers as well as an ethical, and formal testing process.
      As the sole designer on this project, my expertise does not go far beyond
      design. So, bringing in people from many different fields to contribute
      their expertise to this product, will be a valuable step in making this
      product more inclusive and valuable for users.
