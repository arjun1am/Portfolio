          <span class="subheading">Overview</span>
          I lead a small design team responsible for creating a visual identity
          and it's assets for the 2019 TEDx event at Emily Carr University of Art
          and Design. The identity was based on the event's theme: Greater Than You.

         Arjun Menon: Design Lead, Motion Design    <br>
         Rebecca Lo: Attendee badges    <br>
         Sophia Cho: Program Guide    <br>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <span class="subheading">Process</span>
           Managing dreams and reality was a big challenge. With the small team we had and limited
           time commitment, the amount of graphic assets would have to be limited
           in order to create a cohesive visual identity.

           The top most priority was to design and finalize the visual identity guidelines.
           This was a collaborative process where team members brought in sketches and ideas which we then
           brought together elements of each perspective in a cohesive identity. We made sure to keep in mind the
           event theme and vision, and all it's participants. With multiple touchpoints for the event,
           the design responsibilities split between each team member.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <span class="subheading">Design Decisions</span>
          I initially came into the position as the design lead to help guide a direction
          with the theme logo. I proposed a decision to not have another logo (in addition to
          the TEDx logo) for the event and rather have the visual assets represent the
          theme. This decision took into account how the event attendees would understand
          the event's structure and iconography. This was one of many decisions I made as the
          design lead in order to make things seamless and clear.
          <br><br>
          <span style="color:#233042; font-weight:500">Wins:</span>
          Simplifying the design assets, making things cohesive.
          <br>
          <span style="color:#233042; font-weight:500">Losses:</span>
          Not enough collaboration between teams (Communicating more with the
          interactive exhibition team and animation short team would have brought
          the event together better)
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <span class="subheading">Motion Design</span>
          In order to drive and increase engagement before the event, I had designed motion graphic posts that
          introduced the speakers and the subject of their talk. These were posted on social media
          days before the event. The "greater than" symbol grid allowed for a great
          level of flexibility and playfulness in the various iterations while maintaining
          the identity contraints.

        <p class="paragraph">
        <span class="subheading">Takeaways</span>
        Designing an event visual identity was an overall fun experience. What was challenging for me
        was learning and applying the role of design lead. With a small team and limited time commitment from
        everyone, finding ways to collaborate, prioritize, and share design responsiblities was challenging
        to do in a way that kept the design outcomes clean and cohesive.
