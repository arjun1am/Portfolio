          I lead a small design team responsible for creating the visual identity
          for the 2019 TEDx event at Emily Carr University of Art and Design.
          The identity was based on the event's theme; Greater Than You.

         Arjun Menon: Design Lead, Motion Design    <br>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <span class="subheading">Process:</span>
           Managing dreams and reality was a big challenge. With the small team we had and limited
           time commitment, the amount of graphic assets would have to be limited
           in order to create a cohesive visual identity.

           The most top most priority was to design and finalize the visual identity guidelines.
           This was a collaborative process where team members brought in sketches and ideas which we then
           brought together elements of each perspective in a cohesive identity. We made sure to keep in mind the
           event theme and vision, and all it participants.

           With multiple designed touchpoints for the event, the responsibilities were split between
           the design team.

        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          <span class="subheading">Big Decisions:</span>
          I came into the position as the design lead to help guide a direction
          with the logo. I decided to not have a separate logo for the theme and
          simply have the symbol to represent the theme.
          <br><br>
          <span style="background-color:yellow">Wins:</span>
          simplifying the design assets, making things cohesive.
          <br>
          <span style="background-color:yellow">Losses:</span>
          Not enough collaboration between teams (interactive exhibition team,
          short animation team)
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            <span class="subheading">Takeaways</span><br>
        Designing an event visual identity was an overall fun experience. What was challenging for me
        was learning and applying the role of design lead. With a small team and limited time commitment from
        everyone, finding ways to collaborate, prioritize, and share design responsiblities was challenging
        to do in a way that keeps the design outcomes clean and cohesive.
